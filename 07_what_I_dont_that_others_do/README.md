# The things that I don't do that other might be doing

If you reached this point for sure there is a big chance that you are thinking to yourself, what about other well established things developer do that I didn't mention here.

The thing is that I’m a minimalist and try to live my life with as little thing as possible and this rule applies to the physical world and the same for the digital one.

My approach for decided what I keep and what I throw away is pain. Before I left with a small crayon worth of stuff, I did took whatever I thought necessary and put it away, and lived without that thing for am month to see if my live became worst without it, and if after a month I badly remember that I had or used that thing, I would get rid of it.

With software this is easier because you can delete an app, and if like get painful and super annoying without that software or configuration, then I know that I need that because the advantage of using is now tangible and I know that my life will get better.

Knowing that this are the things that I purposefully don’t do that other might be doing:

- I don’t care about my dot files. I have a super basic configuration to just show the branch that I’m on Git, but after my latest fresh reinstall of the system I didn’t bother reconfiguring my bash environment, and it seams that I’m fine with it for now. But I see myself login back to this one day
- I try to avoid Brew like fire. The only time I install something through it I do it to install wget. I don’t use Brew because I don’t like CLI that install things without a visual interface or cue of what goes where. Normally the Unix system is very ease going when it comes to installing things, but annoyingly uninstalling is a very poor experience. Same goes with NPM and installing things globally - I install globally only the bare minimum, which in my case is Nodemon, and my 2 tools that I created ([express-generator-dg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-dg), [env-auto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-auto)) since life without them would be painful.
- The cool drop down feature of iTerm2. Yes I don’t use this amazing feature where you can assign a hot key to iTerm2 that once hit it will slide down a terminal window no matter where you are in the system. Cool feature that I used once back in the days, and it never stick with me. I just don’t have the need. Plus I always have a iTerm2 session open in full screen so when I need I just go there and do my thing, plus once I go to the terminal I normal stay there for a longer time then I always anticipate - mmm that black void ;)

This are some points that my friend [@sadovnychyi](https://github.com/sadovnychyi) pointed out so for sure I won’t be able to include them all or thing of all the possibilities. So if I didn't mention something here is probably because I had a reason and the reason is that I’m not in pain by not using them. Of course it is possible that I might not know all the possibilities out there, in this case feel free to ping me on Twitter @[davidgatti](https://twitter.com/dawidgatti) and let me know what you do that I didn’t mention so I can check it out :)
