💻 My Development Setup for my Mac

If you Google "[My Development Setup](https://www.google.com/search?q=My+Development+Setup)" you will find many articles where different developers explain what type of setup they have. But most often then then not they are very superficial with one detailed explanation and the rest are just links to the apps the they have and use. I wanted to do a more comprehensive article where I go in details and provide exact examples of my configuration files and explain also how to setup the tools that I use - in this case mainly how I did setup Virtual Box, Nginx and how I manage custom local domains.

# Lets start

Personally I’m a very organized individual, because I believe that by spending the extra time in the beginning will save me huge amount of time down the road. Thus by having a well designed development environment is so important to me. I hope you'll find in this article something interesting.
