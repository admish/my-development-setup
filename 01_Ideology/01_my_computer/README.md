We need to start with the device on which the work is performed, and my weapon of choice is the 13‚Äù MacBook Air, because of its reliability and Apple support. Since this device helps me make money, I need a backup plan that works almost globally. Meaning that if it breaks down, it's going to be repaired the next day. If not, I can just buy a new one, log in, and pick up where I left off.

If you don‚Äôt want to use a Apple computer, just pick a PC that has access to solid support, no matter where you are. Also be sure that you can buy the exact same hardware if it fails, so you can just restore or reinstall what you need and continue to develop.

Today's laptops are so well made that failure is very rare, but when it happens, it's panic mode. üòÖHaving a plan in place will help you avoid a lot of scrambling if the equipment does fail.
