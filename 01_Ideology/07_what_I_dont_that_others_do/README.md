# The things that I don't do that other might be doing

At this point, you might be thinking, *What about other well established things developer do that weren't mentioned here?*

The thing is, Iâ€™m a minimalist, and I try to live my life with as few things as possible. This rule applies to both the physical and digital worlds.

My approach to deciding what to keep and what to throw away is pain. Before I left with a small carry-on's worth of stuff, I took what I thought necessary and put it away. I then lived without that item for a month to see if my life became worse without it. After a month, if I didn't miss it, I would get rid of it.

This process is easier with software, because you can delete an app. If I wind up missing that software or configuration, I know I need it, because its advantages are now tangible, and I know that having it will improve my life.

Here are the things that I purposely donâ€™t do that others might be doing.

## Dot Files

I donâ€™t care about my dot files. I had a super basic configuration that just shows on which branch Iâ€™m on Git. But after my latest fresh reinstall of the system, I didnâ€™t bother to reconfigure my bash environment, and Iâ€™m fine with that for now. Right now I donâ€™t feel any pain by not having this feature in the terminal - so for now Iâ€™m not bordering with configuring my bash environment.

## Brew

I try to avoid Brew like fire. I only use it to install wget.

I donâ€™t use Brew because I donâ€™t like CLIs that install things without a visual interface or a clue as to what goes where. The Unix system is typically very easygoing when it comes to installing things, but it's not so great when you want to uninstall apps.

I feel the same way about NPM and installing things globally. I only install globally when I absolutely have to. In my case, that's Nodemon and the two tools I created ([express-generator-dg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-dg), [env-auto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-auto)), since life without them would be painful.

## iTerm2 drop-down

This is the cool drop-down feature of iTerm2. I donâ€™t use this amazing feature that allows you to assign a hot key to iTerm2 that slides down a terminal window, no matter where you are in the system. It's a cool feature that I did use back in the day, but it never stuck with me. I just donâ€™t have the need. Plus, I always have an iTerm2 session open in full screen, so when I need it, I can just go there and do my thing. Once I go to the terminal, I usually stay there for longer than I anticipate...Mmm, that black void ðŸ˜‰.

# To sum it up

These are some things that my friend [@sadovnychyi](https://github.com/sadovnychyi) pointed out, and I'm not able to include all of them or think of all of the possibilities. So if I left something out, it's probably because not using them hasn't caused problems to me. Of course, it's possible that I might not be aware of all of the possibilities out there. In that case, feel free to ping me on Twitter [@davidgatti](https://twitter.com/dawidgatti) and let me know what you do that I didnâ€™t mention so I can check it out ðŸ˜Œ.
