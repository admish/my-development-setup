# Backups

We have the computer. So how do we manage backups? Well, I just donâ€™t have them, so there is one less thing to worry about and be dependent on. Plus, system backups require a huge amount of storage space, and they're slow because they deal with individual files. Thus, doing a backup, even to a fast NAS on a fast local network, takes a lot of time. Not to mention that this solution isn't flexible enough for when you travel. It's almost impossible to find a flash drive that can handle the amount of writes the backup system will perform, and dragging an SSD along with you is just too clunky.

My solution is to avoid having files to back up. For those files that I do want to back up, I just use cloud storage. Since I have so few files, it's fast, and a good internet connection isn't required to back up or restore those files.

## How do I back up regular files?

Apple iCloud is my place of choice. It's built in to the system (no extra software to worry about), and it's cheap at 99 cents for 50GB. Over the years, I've only used 11GB, so it offers plenty of space for me for no money at all.

If I have to use software, I always choose the one that supports iCloud, because I know that the data will be backed up and will still be there if there's a catastrophe.

## How do I backup my files?

All of my code is stored on GitHub. But why donâ€™t I just use iCloud? In this case, the system freaks out when a file is constantly changed, and I encountered some issues that led to the decision to always use GitHub. I do store some legacy projects in iCloud because I donâ€™t actively develop the code; it's just there for reference.

When I develop, I also make lots of small commits to minimize the amount of code lost when something bad happens.
Another GitHub benefit: If you somehow pick up malware that tries to add malicious code to your project, you can spot it in your next commit by looking at the changes before you submit them. This might be unlikely, but you never know. Lots of things can happen in 50 to 70 years! ðŸ˜‰

## How do I back up my apps?

If possible, the Apple App Store is my default place for buying apps. The App Store allows me to quickly reinstall apps without having to worry about Keys and Licenses, and the system takes care of every update.

I do use apps that aren't available in the App Store or that were removed by Apple for whatever reason, but I try to keep those to a minimum.

## To sum it up

I believe that performing frequent backups is an antiquated way to keep files safe. This type of backup works in an antiquated way, and stores too many files that are honestly no longer necessary. If you use iCloud along with an iCloud-supporting app, you donâ€™t need to back up the apps themselves, the app settings, or the app data. You just need to freshly install the system, install the app from the App Store, and log in to iCloud. You'll find everything as you left it.
