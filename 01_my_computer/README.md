# My computer

We need to start with the device were the work is performed, and my weapon of choice the 13” MacBook Air because of it reliability and Apple support. Since this device helps me make money I need a backup plan that works almost globally. Meaning if it brakes down, it is going to be repaired the next day, if not. I can just buy a new one, log-in and be where I left off.

If you don’t want to use a Apple computer, just pick a PC that have a solid support no matter where you are, and where you can buy the same exact hardware if it fails so you can just restore or reinstall what you need an be developing.

Laptops now days are so well made that failure is very rare, but when it happens it is panic mode 😅. Don’t scramble when this happens, just have a plan before hand and you know that you’ll be ok.
