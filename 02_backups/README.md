# Backups

We have he computer, so how do we manage backups - well I just don’t have them, so there is one less thing to worry about and be dependent on. Plus system backups take a huge a amount of data and are slow since they deal with individual files. Thus doing a backup even on a local fast network and to a fast NAS takes a lot of time. Not to mention this solution is not flexible enough for when you travel. Because it is almost impossible to find a flash drive that can handle the amount of writes the backup system will perform and dragging a SSD is just to clunky.

So my solution is to not have files to backup. And for those files that I want backup, just use cloud storage. Since I have little - it is fast, and I don’t require a super fast internet connection to backup or restore those files.

## How do I backup regular files

Apple iCloud is my place of choices. It is built in to the system (no extra software to worry about), it is chap: $0.99 for 50GB where over the years I just used 11GB of that. So it is plenty of space for me for no money at all.

If I have to use a peace of software I always choose the one that support iCloud, because I know that the data will be backed up and be there after a catastrophe.

## How do I backup my files

All my code is stored on GitHub, but why I don’t use jut iCloud? Because in this case the system freaks out when a file get constantly changed, and I encountered some issues that made me just use GitHub all he way. But for sure I do store some legacy projects in iCloud since I don’t actively develop that code, they are just there for reference.

When I develop I also make lots of small commits to make to minimize how much code I would potentially lose when something bad happens.

Plus a nice benefit of using git is that if you for some reason got a malware that tries to add some malicious code to your project, you can spot this in your next commit if you look at the changes before submitting the new code. It is maybe unlikely, but you never know. Lots of things can happen in 70 to 80 years ;)

## How do I backup my apps

If possible my default place to buy an app is for sure the Apple App Store. The App Store allows me to quickly reinstall an app with worrying about Key and Licenses, plus very time there is an update the system takes care of it.

I do have apps that don’t exists in the App Store or sadly were removed by Apple because of reasons. But I try to keep them to minimum

## To sum it up

I believe regular backups are an antiquated way to for keep your file safe. Plus they work in an antiquated way where they store to many files the are honestly not needed anymore. If you use iCloud, and the app that you use supports iCloud. Then you don’t need to backup the app, the app settings and the app data. You just need a fresh install of the system, install the app from the App Store, log-in in to iCloud and everything is as you left it.
